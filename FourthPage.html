<h1 style="color:Red;">The Middle Ages</h1>

    <p>The Middle Ages was a time of about AD 500 to 1500</p>
    <p>It was also known as the middle ages</p>
    <p>The feudal system, this was how land was owned and soceity was organised.</p>
    <p>Most peasants were serfs. They belonged to the lord and farmed his land. They got their own small piece of land, and in return they had to work  for free on the lordr's land. They had to pay taxes yo him and the priest</p>
    <p>Some peasants were freemen, this meant that they did not have to give free labour to the lord but paid him  rent.</p>
    <p>Peasants rarely ate meat.</p>
    <p>Life in a medieval castle: The most important person i a castle was the lord, who lived there with his family. The castle and all the land around it belonged to him. But if the lord betrayed the king he would lose it all.</p>
    <p>The lord and his family lived in the keep.</p>
    <p>Up to the 1300,s most lords could barely read or write. They had no need to, because they kept a priest to do that for them. he also acted as a schoolmaster to the lord's sons until they were seven years old.</p>
    <p>Rich men wore long tunics. Shoes were made of leather and were pointed. The long toes were stuffed with horsehair.</p>
    <p>The lord appointed a bailiff to oversee the village for him. The bailiff made sure the peasants paid rents and taxes. He also looked after law and order.</p>
    <p>As soon as a lord got land from a king he built a castle on it. He needed to defend homself and his people from enemies.</p>
    <p>The first catles were called motte and bailey. They were made of wood and very easy to build. The motte and bailey castles had a small his built by peasants called a motte, it had a wooden fort built at the top of the motte, below the fory was a big enclosure this was called the bailey.</p>
    <p>When a lord had control of a countryside he replaced the motte and bailey castles with stone castles. The keep was the main building in the castle this was where the lord and lady lived, the battlements were at the top of the keep all day long soilders kept guard on the battlements, curtain walls were the outer walls pf the castle, turrets were strong towers along the walls, the drawbridge was raised at night if an enemy approached, the portcullis was an iron grille that could be lowered in front of a castle gate, the ramparts went along the top of all the walls, the moat was a ditch around the castle dilled with water, in front of the keep was an open space called a courtyard or bailey, the latrines were the toilets of the castle.</p> 
    <p>Whe  a castle was attacked the local people would rush inside the walls for safety. The enemy used many different things during a siege, battering rams were used against a gate, catapults would launch bolders over the walls, a ballista was a giant crossbow that fired large arrow, a siege tower was enclosed ladders that were used to scale the walls, sometimes tunnels were dug under the walls, siege ladders were used to try scale the walls.</p>
